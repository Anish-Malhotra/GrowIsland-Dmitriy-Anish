What was once an attempt to replicate the flash-game Tinysasters 2 turned into a game of epic proportions.
Penny Pitch is a game in one launches a series of pennies from a catapult attempting to obtain a high score by hitting the
'3' in the middle of the board. Play it out and see what you get!

More information can be obtained from the game's help/about menus.

Thanks to Adam Peled for being a great friend for helping so much with bug-testing and imparting impressive knowledge of LibGDX to Dmitriy
and I.

INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE:
1) Download a zip of this repository or clone it.
2) Run the executable 'Penny Pitch' jar file. This is multiplatform, but you might have to right click/run as administrator for it to work.
3) Alternatively you can import the 'Penny Pitch' directory into the Eclipse IDE as a Gradle Project and run the 'Penny Pitch-desktop' directory as a Java Application.

**Unfortunately the setup of LibGDX doesn't allow for compiling through the terminal to our knowledge**

SOMETHING WE USED FROM THIS TERM:
We implemented a shortest-distance algorithm for finding the distance to the cannon after launch.
